# Getting started

* Create a PostgreSQL database
* Execute a script to create schema(tables) and data

You'll write your statements in **pgAdmin**. pgAdmin connects to a PostgreSQL database server so you can run SQL statements and perform other database-related functions. Refer to the unit about PostgreSQL in the Intro to Tools section of this course for details on getting started with PostgreSQL and pgAdmin.

## PizzaShop

### Create the database

In pgAdmin, connect to PostgreSQL, and click on the **Databases** node to select it. Right click and select Create -> Database..
